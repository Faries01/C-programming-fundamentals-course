*/ Statistics are often calculated with varying amounts of input data. Write a program that takes any number of non-negative integers 
as input, and outputs the max and average. A negative integer ends the input and is not included in the statistics. Assume the input 
contains at least one non-negative integer. Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, 
which can be achieved by executing cout << fixed << setprecision(2); once before all other cout statements. /*



#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

   int main() {
      float sum = 0;
      int count = 0;
      int max = 0;
      int maxinput;

      cin >> maxinput;

      while (maxinput >= 0) {
         count = count + 1;
         sum = sum + maxinput;
      if (maxinput > max) 
      max = maxinput;
      cin >> maxinput;
      }
      
      cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
      cout << max << " ";
      cout << sum / count << endl;   
        
      return 0;
      
   }
