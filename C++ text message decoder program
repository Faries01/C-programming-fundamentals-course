// Use getline() to get a line of user input into a string. Output the line. (3 pts)
*/  Search the string (using find()) for common abbreviations and print a list of each found abbreviation along with its decoded meaning. (3 pts)
Ex:

Enter text:
IDK if I'll go. It's my BFF's birthday. 
You entered: IDK if I'll go. It's my BFF's birthday. 
BFF: best friend forever
IDK: I don't know
Support these abbreviations:

BFF -- best friend forever
IDK -- I don't know
JK -- just kidding
TMI -- too much information
TTYL -- talk to you later   /*
